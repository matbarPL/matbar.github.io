Hello! 🙋

My name is Mateusz and I have nearly four years of professional experience. I was working in management consulting, startup and in Fortune 500 company. Considering these experiences I have developed my communication and analytical skills. As a part of multiple international projects, I have dived into complex data sets and delivered comprehensive analyses for the world's largest companies.

Being a student in two fields of studies, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science has given me exceptional opportunities to gain mainly technical engineering knowledge. In June 2022 I finished full-time master's degree studies at University of Warsaw, in the field of Data Science and Business Analytics.

Witnessing the power of data in close-knit teams is something that I enjoy the most. Conducting the whole process for clients highly appeals to my ethos of hard-working and being passionate about the avid transformations performed for different industries. During the engagements, I was often conducting presentations or workshops for colleagues from the business.

Besides work, I like spending time doing sports, cooking 🍔 and reading 📚.

Please contact me via SNS if you have any questions or want to get to know me 🤝
